# RFM-Customer-Segmentation-for-Ad-Targeting
This project segments online retail customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. It visualizes these segments with PCA, enabling the creation of targeted ad campaigns for distinct groups like loyal, new, and dormant customers.
